# Trane - Demos
This repository contains walkthroughs for using the novel Trane technology to automatically generate prediction problems and solve them.

Given a dataset we use:
* Trane to automatically generate prediction problems and create "Label-times"
* Use Featuretools to automatically generate features. The result is a feature matrix with labels. 
* Use ATM to search for models and create several machine learning models.
